## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    Computers use IP addresses to locate one another so they can communicate.

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    A lookup service called Domain Name Service (DNS), maps a symbolic name (like www.utexas.edu) to its corresponding IP address.

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Static IPs don'e change whereas dynamic IPs can change over time.

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    TCP ports provide reliable communication and UDP ports provide unreliable best-effort communication.

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Blynk is event based so using delay() will break it.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    It doesn't let any other code execute while it is being executed

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    It allows for code to be executed based on priority

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interface is what the user uses to interact with the code. Implementation is how the interface is used with the code to execute whatever it needs to execute.
